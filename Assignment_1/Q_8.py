# Write a program that reads in the radius of a circle and prints the circleâ€Ÿs diameter,
# circumference and area. Use the constant value 3.14159 for pi. Perform each of these
# calculations inside the print statement(s) and use the conversion format specifier %f.

print("The circumference of the circle is %f" %(2*pi*float(radius)) )
