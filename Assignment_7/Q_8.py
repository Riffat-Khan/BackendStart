# Given a string you are provided with the possible operations.
# We can group the adjacent substrings, for e.g ABCABCBC can be compressed asÂ 
# 2ABC1BC or 1ABCA2BC
# Among all the possible options, task is to find the resultant string with the
# minimum length.
# In case if there are multiple solutions return the lexicographically smallest string.
# So for the above example the solution would be 2ABC1BC
# Another example would be
# FLFLAFLAFLAF
# Solution: 1FLF3LAF
